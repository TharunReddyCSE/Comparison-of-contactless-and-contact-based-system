### Abstract

Fingerprint recognition is a pivotal component of biometric identification systems and plays a critical role in ensuring security and precision in various applications. This project proposes a method to enhance the accuracy of fingerprint recognition systems, aiming to improve the efficiency and precision of biometric identification processes. By leveraging advanced techniques in image processing and machine learning, the proposed approach addresses the challenges associated with variations in fingerprint patterns, image quality, and environmental factors. Through experimental validation and performance analysis, the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing recognition accuracy is demonstrated. The results indicate promising improvements in biometric identification efficiency, paving the way for more reliable and secure authentication systems in various domains.
