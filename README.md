## Comparison-of-contactless-and-contact-based-system

### Abstract

Fingerprint recognition is a pivotal component of biometric identification systems and plays a critical role in ensuring security and precision in various applications. This project proposes a method to enhance the accuracy of fingerprint recognition systems, aiming to improve the efficiency and precision of biometric identification processes. By leveraging advanced techniques in image processing and machine learning, the proposed approach addresses the challenges associated with variations in fingerprint patterns, image quality, and environmental factors. Through experimental validation and performance analysis, the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing recognition accuracy is demonstrated. The results indicate promising improvements in biometric identification efficiency, paving the way for more reliable and secure authentication systems in various domains.

### Objectives

- Load and Prepare datasets for pre-processing & model training.
- Design a Siamese CNN model for a comparison framework.
- Evaluate the Siamese model on the Test data.
- Check the similarities and dissimilarities in the Fingerprints

### About the Project

- This was our Final Year CSE 2024 Project, which aims to showcase the effectiveness of contactless fingerprints in comparison to contact-based Fingerprints.
- By comparing both the Fingerprints using the Siamese model we were able to identify the similarities and dissimilarities in the fingerprints by labeling them as class 0 and class 1.
- We achieved an accuracy of 60%.
